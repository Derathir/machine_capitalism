# machine_capitalism
A quick pygame - my final project submission for U of Helsinki's MOOC Advanced Course in Programming.

Project assignment:
https://programming-23.mooc.fi/part-14/4-your-own-game

The gist of the assignment was given as follows:

#The game should contain the following features:
#The game has a sprite the player can move in some way
#The game has some collectable items and/or enemies
#The player needs to be set a clear task in the game
#The game contains a counter which tells the player how they are doing in the game
#The source code for the game is divided into functions like in the Sokoban example

And we were given a few basic .png assets to use and go play!

Definitely the biggest learning moment was how to handle angular sprite movement using pygame's vector functions!
There were some basics of the game that could have been done more concisely with more of pygame's functionality (sprites, rects, collision),
but I had already built e.g. a Sprite class from scratch for previous exercises, so I just used what I already had.
